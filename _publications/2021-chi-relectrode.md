RElectrode presents a novel reconfigurable electrode that leverages microfluidic techniques to dynamically change its geometry and material properties. This innovation enables sensing of diverse user inputs including touch and touchless gestures, pressure, temperature, and can distinguish between different types of objects or liquids, making it highly versatile for interactive applications.
