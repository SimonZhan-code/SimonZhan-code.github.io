MicroFluID introduces a novel RFID artifact based on a multiple-chip structure and microfluidic switches. Unlike traditional RFID sensing approaches that rely on primitive signal analysis, MicroFluID directly reads variable ID information to determine input states, providing more robust and reliable interaction sensing capabilities.
