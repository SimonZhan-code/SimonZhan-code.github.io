This paper addresses the challenge of safe reinforcement learning when only pixel observations are available. We propose a novel algorithm that efficiently encodes state-wise safety constraints with unknown hazard regions through a latent barrier function learning mechanism. The approach enables safe policy learning directly from high-dimensional visual observations without requiring explicit state representations.
