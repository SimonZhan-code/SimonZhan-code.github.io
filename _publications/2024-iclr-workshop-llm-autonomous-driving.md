This paper addresses significant safety challenges in autonomous driving (AD) systems, particularly in long-tail unforeseen driving scenarios. The work explores integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into AD systems to leverage their robust common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities. The proposed methodologies employ LLMs as intelligent decision-makers in behavioral planning, augmented with a safety verifier shield for contextual safety learning. The paper presents two key studies in simulated environments: an adaptive LLM-conditioned Model Predictive Control (MPC) and an LLM-enabled interactive behavior planning scheme with a state machine, demonstrating superior performance and safety metrics compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
