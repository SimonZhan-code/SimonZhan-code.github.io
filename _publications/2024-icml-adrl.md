This paper presents Auxiliary-Delayed Reinforcement Learning (AD-RL), a novel framework that addresses the challenge of learning with long observation delays in reinforcement learning. The key innovation is leveraging an auxiliary short-delayed task to accelerate learning on the primary long-delayed task, maintaining performance quality in stochastic environments.
